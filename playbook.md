# TED AI Open Source Hackathon Playbook

[TED AI Open Source Hackathon](https://www.ai-event.ted.com/hackathon) was an ancillary event to the main [TED AI](https://www.ai-event.ted.com/) event. The 30 hours hackathon started at 10 am, October 14th, and finished at 4 pm, October 15th, 2023. Microsoft Reactor office in San Francisco. The purpose of the hackathon was to utilize the transformative power of AI for good to benefit the community. We decided early on to align with [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). This provided us with a well-known framework and truly aligned with our mission.

## Application Review process

We got a total of 91 applications with ~250 participants. An Application Entrant rubric was created to ensure equitable evaluation of the application. Each core team member reviewed a specific number of applications. We were limited by the capacity of the place hosting the hackathon so unfortunately could not accept them all. The applications were graded as green, purple, orange, and red. The applications in each bucket were approved based on how many applicants could be accommodated. FWIW this may not be the criteria next time.

## Judging

We did two rounds of judging. There were 18 judges for round 1 and 6 judges for round 2.
