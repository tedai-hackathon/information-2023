# TED AI Open Source Hackathon Playbook

[TED AI Open Source Hackathon](https://www.ai-event.ted.com/hackathon) was an ancillary event to the main [TED AI](https://www.ai-event.ted.com/) event. The 30-hour hackathon started at 10 am on October 14th, and finished at 4 pm on October 15th, 2023. The purpose of the hackathon was to utilize the transformative power of AI for good to benefit the community. We decided early on to align with [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). This provided us with a well-known framework and truly aligned with our mission of making a social impact.

Date: October 14 and 15, 2023
Location: Microsoft Reactor Office, 555, California Street, San Francisco, CA.

[LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/) created the GitHub repo for us. GitHub was the title sponsor. Google Maker Suite and Venture Science were other co-sponsors.

## Application Review process

We got a total of 91 applications with ~250 participants. An Application Entrant rubric was created to ensure equitable evaluation of the application. Each core team member reviewed a specific number of applications. We were limited by the capacity of the place hosting the hackathon so unfortunately could not accept them all. The applications were graded as green, purple, orange, and red. The applications in each bucket were approved based on how many applicants could be accommodated. FWIW this may not be the criteria next time.

## Registration

The teams were assigned specific rooms in the facility. They could move during the day but they need to be in their assigned teams for evaluation.

## Evaluation

We did two rounds of judging. There were 18 judges for round 1 and 6 judges for round 2.

Round 1 was science fair-style. A team of 2 judges and an escort went to the pre-assigned teams. Each judging team covered 4 hackathon teams. The team got 5 mins to show their work and 5 minutes of interactive Q&A with the judges. The judges got 2 mins to cast their votes.

Round 2 was shark tank-style. The 6 judges sat in a panel and the teams presented in front of everybody. The teams got 5 mins to show their work and 5 minutes of interactive Q&A. The judges got 2 minutes to cast their votes.

### Judging platform

HackerEarth was used as the [platform for hackathon](https://tedaihackathon.hackerearth.com/).
