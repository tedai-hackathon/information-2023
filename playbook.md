# TED AI Open Source Hackathon Playbook

[TED AI Open Source Hackathon](https://www.ai-event.ted.com/hackathon) was an ancillary event to the main [TED AI](https://www.ai-event.ted.com/) event. The 2-day hackathon was on October 14th and 15th, 2023 at the Microsoft Reactor office in San Francisco. The purpose of the hackathon was to utilize the transformative power of AI for good to benefit the community. We decided early on to align with [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). This provided us with a well-known framework and truly aligned with our mission.

Date: October 14 and 15, 2023
Location: Microsoft Reactor Office, 555, California Street, San Francisco, CA.
