# Sample TED AI Application Idea

## Idea
Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for the early detection of diseases in corn plants can significantly contribute to addressing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger (SDG 2). This goal aims to eliminate hunger, enhance food security, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.
Our entry will utilize convolutional neural networks to swiftly identify diseases that affect corn crops. By analyzing images and data collected from the fields, our algorithms can accurately detect signs of disease, allowing for timely intervention. This early disease detection is essential in ensuring crop health and, consequently, securing food production. By focusing on disease detection using AI, we can:
- Prevent Crop Loss: Early identification enables farmers to take prompt measures to prevent the spread of infections, minimizing crop loss. This aligns directly with SDG 2's goal of improving food security.
- Minimize Chemical Usage: Targeted interventions based on AI assessments reduce the need for excessive pesticide and herbicide use, supporting sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices (SDG 2.4).
- Enhance Crop Resilience: Disease detection enables farmers to adopt proactive measures to protect their crops against potential threats, contributing to a more resilient agricultural sector in the face of climate change (SDG 2.4).

## Dataset
We intend to use the following public domain dataset to train our algorithms and develop our app:
[Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smaranjitghose/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease-dataset) (almost 5000 images of corn plants and associated diseases)

## Demo
We will demonstrate a mobile app that farmers can use to take pictures of corn plants. The AI will analyze the image and report on the plant health and specific mitigations. The same app can be leveraged in drones or any technology with a camera attached.
